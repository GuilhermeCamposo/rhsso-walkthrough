== Intro to OTP

Red Hat Single Sign-On has a number of policies you can set up for your FreeOTP or Google Authenticator One-Time Password generator. When configuring OTP, FreeOTP and Google Authenticator can scan a QR code that is generated on the OTP set up page that Red Hat Single Sign-On has. 

There are two different algorithms to choose from for your OTP generators. Time Based (TOTP) and Counter Based (HOTP). For TOTP, your token generator will hash the current time and a shared secret. The server validates the OTP by comparing all the hashes within a certain window of time to the submitted value. So, TOTPs are valid only for a short window of time (usually 30 seconds). For HOTP a shared counter is used instead of the current time. The server increments the counter with each successful OTP login. So, valid OTPs only change after a successful login.
