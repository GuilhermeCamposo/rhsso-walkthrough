== Instructions

=== Etherpad

Etherpad is a shared notepad. We will use it to share content and also control the user of each student.

Before continuing, access the Etherpad through the link below:

{{ ETHERPAD_URL }}[Etherpad,window="_blank"]

Choose a user from the predefined ones and put your `name`, `email` and `job title` in front to indicate your choice. This account will be used by you throughout the test drive. For example:

[source,text]
----
...
user10=Luke Skywalker (luke.skywalker@starwars.com - Jedi)
...
----

If the user already has a name on the front it means that someone has already chosen it. In that case choose another one that is available.

As soon as you choose your username, add it at the top so that all guides reflect this change.

After doind that, you will see that the user below will change. That will happen on all labs.

----
User = {{ USER_ID }}
----

=== Web Console

Openshift comes with a web console that will allow users to perform various tasks via the browser. To access the console, open the following URL:

{{ OPENSHIFT_MASTER_URL }}[Web Console,window="_blank"]

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. You will be asked for your username and password. +
To log in use the user previously chosen and the password provided by the instructor:

[source,text]
----
Username: {{ USER_ID }}
Password: openshift
----

=== Command line

If you want, you can use a terminal that runs in the web browser. To do this, use `Google Chrome` or` Firefox`. Don't even think about using Microsoft Edge please;)

The link for the terminal is below:

{{ TERMINAL_URL }}[Terminal,window="_blank"]

To access the terminal, you need to log into Openshift with the chosen user on Etherpad. The instructor will advise you on the password.
