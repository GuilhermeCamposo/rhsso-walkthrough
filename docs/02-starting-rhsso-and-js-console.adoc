You can run Red Hat SSO locally or using containers on Openshift. Choose one of the option below.

== Option 1: Locally

* Execute *docker pull* to download both **Red Hat Single Sign On** and **JS Console:**

----
  docker pull viniciusmartinez/rhsso73:1.0
  docker pull luszczynski/sso-console-app:1.0
----

* Bootstrap both **Red Hat Single Sign ON** and **JS Console:**

----
  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 viniciusmartinez/rhsso73:1.0
  docker run -it -p 80:80 luszczynski/sso-console-app:1.0
----

* if you modify **Red Hat Single Sign On** default port don't forget to update *keycloak.json;*
* Open a browser of your choice and try to access **Red Hat Single Sign On** on the following address with *admin/admin* credentials: http://localhost:8080/auth
* Open a new tab and try to access **JS Console** on the following address: http://localhost:80

== Option 2: Openshift (Recommended)

First, we need to login on Openshift.

* Username: userXX (where XX is your specific number)
* Password: `openshift`

Make sure you are in the `Developer perspective` and in the namespace sso`XX`.

=== Deploy SSO

* Click on `+Add` -> `From Catalog`

* Search for `sso` in the filter field and select `Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 (Ephemeral)`

* Click on `Instantiatee Template`
image:2020-05-27-17-56-28.png[]
* Leave the fields as they are and just change both `RH-SSO Administrator Username` and `RH-SSO Administrator Password` to `admin`

* Wait while Openshift pull the necessary images for Red Hat SSO. When it has finished, you'll see the following screen

=== Deploy js-console

* On the left menu, click on `+Add` -> `Container Image`
image:2020-05-27-18-00-20.png[]
* Use `docker.io/luszczynski/rhsso-js-console-app:1.0` in the `Image name from external registry` field
* Application Name: `redhat-sso`
* Name: `js-console`
image:2020-05-27-18-03-23.png[]
* Now click on `Create`
* Click on the SSO circle and then on the resources tab, copy the Route URL
image:2020-05-27-18-07-42.png[]
* Open the js-console Deployment by clicking on `js-console`
image:2020-05-27-18-09-38.png[]
* Now select the `Environment` tab and create a new env `AUTH_SERVER_URL` and fill the value field with the content of the URL of SSO. In the end of the SSO URL, add `/auth`. Now click on `Save`

* Switch back to the topology view and Open the js-console app by clicking on the icon

=== Grouping js-console and SSO

* While holding down `Shift`, drag the SSO circle near to the js-console

* Now create a connection between js-console and sso by pulling an arrow from js-console towards sso circle
